#Final Project

##Connor Guerin
The project is meant to run in first person (the camera pans but there is no player movement). Press p to switch to perspective 'flying' camera for closer inspection/grading purposes. The day night cycle takes 36 seconds (10 degrees/sec) to do a complete cycle.

While somewhat simple, I'm especially proud of the day night cycle in the scene. It took quite some time to get the ambient light color transitions correct.
