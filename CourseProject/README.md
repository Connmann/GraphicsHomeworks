#Final Project
##Connor Guerin

##What Remains
 * In the final version of this project the camera will be locked in first person and player movement will be restricted to the sidewalk.
 * Add a police car on the street with flashing red/blue lights
 * Add day/night cycle (changing ambient light)
 * Add basic buildings and fencing to the far edges of the word, to make it seem more "immersive"
 * Chase down an inconsistent seg fault, likely related to the first person camera movement.
